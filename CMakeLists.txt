{
#define shitMake Cmake
#define microshit Microsoft

microshit be like:
"ðŸ¥ºaww you want to learn c++? download this 69 gb of sht software first ðŸ–•"

shitmake be like:
"ðŸ¥ºaww you use GCC compiler? here, take this sln file that I have generated instead ðŸ–•"

shitmake be like:
"ðŸ¥ºaww you don't use MSVC? depricated your ide ðŸ–•"

I'll give shitmake an idea:
Sell your bs built generator to Microshit. It is nothing but sln generator.
Fkn useless piece of software. Waste of human resource. 

I hope someday people stop building stuff with msvc and use shitmake.

Hope every guy that created header only library with simple dependencies get beautiful life and a loving wife.

TL;DR:
I am not using CMAKE. what's the built system then? =>nothing. nothing is the build system. I'll just list the files needed in free time. 
Cross platform can suck my balls. I'll have different repos for different OS.
